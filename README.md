## Avatar Downloader Program

This is a very simple program that accesses GitHub API and downloads all users' avatars.

## Motivation

This was the first project designed by Lighthouse Labs for the September 2016 cohort. The motivation was to practice API access.

## Instructions

The program can be run with: node download_avatars.js *repo_owner_here* *repo_name_here*

Example: node download_avatars.js lighthouse-labs laser_shark

There is no need to create a folder to hold the avatars as one will be created for you :)
